car_control.py

This script defines functions to control a servo motor and a car's DC motors connected to a Raspberry Pi.
It includes functions to:
1. Move the car forward and backward.
2. Control the servo motor to specific angles and reset position.
3. Execute a sequence of movements combining servo and car actions.

This script is intended to be imported and used in projects where precise control of both servo and DC motors is required.

Dependencies:
- RPi.GPIO: Raspberry Pi GPIO library for GPIO control.
- time: Standard Python time module for delays.
